BibleWorks supports Unicode for exporting Greek and Hebrew text into a word processor. You may/may not need to configure this in Bibleworks, depending on what version of BibleWorks you have.

-   **BibleWorks 8 & 9:**Â Exports Unicode by default. You do not need to configure anything unless you want to change the fonts that BibleWorks uses to export.
-   **BibleWorks 7:** You will need to configure Unicode in the BibleWorks settings. To do this, make your Options > Font menu look like the image below (click it to see a larger version).

You can set BibleWorks to export with any Unicode font: I use Gentium for Greek and Ezra SIL for Hebrew, the image below uses other fonts.
