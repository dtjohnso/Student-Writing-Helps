I've long been an advocate of Unicode. That's non-controversial now that all the leading Bible software packages and web browsers support it by default. If you're unfamiliar with the concept, check out [my other resources on this]({{ site.baseurl }}/greek-hebrew-fonts/).

Here are some of my favorite typefaces that support Greek and Hebrew text for biblical studies:

## Western languages (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic)

* [SBL Greek](https://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLGreek.aspx) - Free personal use, commercial license available
* [Brill Typeface](https://brill.com/page/BrillFont/brill-typeface) - Free personal use, commercial license available
* [Gentium](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium) - open-source licensed under the [SIL Open Font License][sil-ofl]
