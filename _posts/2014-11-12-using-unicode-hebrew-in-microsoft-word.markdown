If you don't see the buttons for changing the text direction for a paragraph (pictured above), then you may need to add Hebrew as a supported language in the Microsoft Office Language Settings tool.

Typically you can find the Microsoft Office Language Settings tool by browsing\ 
**Start \> Programs \> Microsoft Office \> Microsoft Office Tools \> Microsoft Office Language Settings**

Make sure your window looks like this one below.
