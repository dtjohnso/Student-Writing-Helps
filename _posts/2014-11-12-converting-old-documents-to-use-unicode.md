If you have an old document that was composed using a non-Unicode font, there are some automated tools that can assist with converting to Unicode. Use tools like this with caution! Success is not guaranteed.

This page offers my current recommended tool for Greek:

* [Randy Leedy's Microsoft Word macro for converting bwgrkl to Unicode Greek](https://www.ntgreekguy.com/unicodemacro) - A macro created by Randy Leedy, who knows a thing or two about bwgrkl, the original BibleWorks Greek font. Includes thorough documentation explaining how to use the tool.

## Greek

*[Update 2019-08-22]: It has been several years since I wrote this post, and I'm not confident about any of the options listed below this line any longer. However, the links still work and point to the same sources that they did when I wrote this, so I leave them in here in case they might help someone out in the future. I have personally tested Randy Leedy's macro above as of this date, and can confirm that it works well and that the code is well-constructed.*
