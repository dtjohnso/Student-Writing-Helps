## So what is "Turabian" anyway, and why should I care? 

Simply put, "Turabian" is shorthand for the widely-accepted academic [style guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) originally published by [Kate L. Turabian of the University of Chicago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_L._Turabian). Like any other style guide, Turabian prescribes specific citation styles and page layout specifications for academic writing.

### You don't need to do this alone.

Rather than spending time that you could be using for writing and researching with the details of page layout, you can use a Word template with predefined styles that follow the Turabian guidelines.

### Read the instructions!

Remember that the technical helps offered here are no substitute for knowing Turabian standards (and the sometimes contradicting instructions of your teachers!).

You simply **must** get a copy of Turabian's book (be sure you have the latest edition), but also pay attention to any style guidelines given to you by your teachers. Know where the two contradict each other, and follow your teacher's prefs.
